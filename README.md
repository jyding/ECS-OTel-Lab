Sumo Logic offers a unified platform for analyzing logs, metrics, and traces generated by your Fargate tasks. This guide details how to leverage AWS FireLens (using Fluent Bit) for log collection and the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector sidecar for metrics and traces, sending all data to Sumo Logic.

**Prerequisites:**

Before you begin, ensure you have:

  1. A Sumo Logic account.

  2. Configured the necessary Hosted Collector Sources in Sumo Logic:

     - An HTTP Logs Source: Note the unique Source Address URI (e.g., /receiver/v1/http/...). This will be used by FireLens/Fluent Bit for Logs

     - An OTLP/HTTP Source: Note the unique Source Address URLs for Traces and Metrics. These will be used by the OpenTelemetry Collector: OTLP/HTTP Source | Sumo Logic Docs 

  3. An operational AWS ECS Cluster configured for Fargate.

  4. Necessary AWS IAM permissions to create/modify ECS Task Definitions, Services, Task Roles, and Task Execution Roles.

  5. Docker images for your application(s) and the OTel Collector pushed to a container registry (like AWS ECR).
